# Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive MAFM (Multi-Ancestry Fine-Mapping) tutorial! This guide will walk you through using MAFM for genetic fine-mapping analysis across different ancestries and cohorts.

## What You'll Learn

This tutorial is organized into several sections that build upon each other:

1. **[Getting Started](tutorial/getting-started.md)** - Learn what MAFM can do and its overall framework
2. **[Quick Start](tutorial/quick-start.md)** - Jump right in with the `mafm pipeline` command
3. **[Single-Input Fine-Mapping](tutorial/single-input.md)** - Fine-mapping with one cohort or ancestry
4. **[Multi-Input Fine-Mapping](tutorial/multi-input.md)** - Fine-mapping across multiple cohorts and ancestries
5. **[Advanced Topics](tutorial/advanced.md)** - Deep dive into parameters and customization

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:

- MAFM installed (see [Installation](installation.md))
- Basic understanding of GWAS and fine-mapping concepts
- Your summary statistics and LD matrices prepared

!!! tip "Example Data"
    Throughout this tutorial, we'll use example datasets included with MAFM. You can find them in the `exampledata/` directory after installation.

## Navigation

Use the navigation menu on the left to jump between sections, or follow the tutorial sequentially using the "Next" links at the bottom of each page.
